          For me, problem-solving and design-thinking are just as important as
          embracing diverse cultures and adapting to new environments on the
          opposite side of the world. That’s why I created this page — not only
          to document my time spent abroad but also to share my experiences,
          stories, and recommendations. Here, you'll find everything I look for
          in a travel blog: honest insights, practical details, and the
          unfiltered truth.
